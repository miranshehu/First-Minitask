    <h1>First Steps to HTML</h1>
    <p>By Miran Shehu Friday, 09 Sept 2022</p>
    <p>What is HTML</p> <br>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is a standard markup 
    language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure 
    of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building 
    blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
    </p>
    <h3>Worth mentioning</h3>
    <p>It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming 
    language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now 
    considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium 
    (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing
    regular updates. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Following with some use cases that HTML has:</p>
    <p> <strong>Web development.</strong> <br> Developers use HTML code to design how a browser
        displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Internet navigation.</strong> <br> Users can easily navigate and 
        insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is 
        heavily used to embed hyperlinks.  
    </p>
    <p><strong>Web documentation.</strong><br>HTML makes it possible to organize
            and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>And here are 3 things you can learn from me today for HTML:</p>
    <h3>1. abbr tag in html</h3>
    <p>The abbr tag in html stands for Abbreviation
    and when its used you can see the word underlined with dots</p>
    <h3>2. The cite tag</h3>
    <p>The use of the cite tag is quite simple
    and you use it when you want to cite something <abbr title="Example Given"><dfn>e.g</dfn></abbr>
    this quote from Takayoshi Y.</p>
    <blockquote><cite>“I learned the fundamentals for programming, which is just what I needed as a first 
    step for my career change!”</cite></blockquote>
    <p>The citing above is nested using cite and blockqute together for fun just to see what happens</p>
    <h3>3. The definition tag</h3>
    <p>Simple like this the dfn tag stands for <dfn>"definition element", and it specifies a term that
    is going to be defined within the content</dfn>
    </p>
